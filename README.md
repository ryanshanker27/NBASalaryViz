With this project, we're gonna look at the NBA teams that are the best and worst at paying reasonable rates for their players, whether this affects the teamâ€™s performance, and examine some trends or reasons why some players are overpaid and others underpaid.

All graphs were created using the three following datasets:

1. A dataset of RAPTOR statistics for modern NBA players for the 2014-2021 seasons from FiveThirtyEight's Github (https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/nba-raptor/modern_RAPTOR_by_player.csv)

2. A table of all NBA player salaries from the 2021-22 season to the future 2024-25 season from HoopsHype (https://hoopshype.com/salaries/players/)

3. Datasets of the win-loss records for the teams in each conference for the first 25 games of the 2021-22 season
from Basketball Reference (https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2022_standings.html)

Some conditions must be acknowledged before proceeding to the graphs. First, all players who played below 500 minutes were ignored and removed from the dataset due to sample sizes that are too small to judge without an asterisk. This also meant that players, like Klay Thompson, who sat out all of the 2021 season due to injury will also be omitted from the data. This project is primarily focused on judging general managers, and general managers should not be blamed for unfortunate injuries to players who could have exceeded their contract value. Second, these statistics only measure player impact on the basketball court, during games. Although it is true that many veteran players have positive impacts on their team outside of games due to their leadership and mentorship of rookies, it is frankly impossible to quantify that impact with a simple number.
